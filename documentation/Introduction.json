Here's how you can do it:<br><br><ol><li>Create a new JSON file inside the 'documentation' folder.</li><li>Name the file according to the topic, replacing spaces with underscores (e.g., 'new_topic.json').</li><li>Structure the JSON file with a 'title' and 'sections'. Each section should contain a 'title' and 'content'.</li><li>Save the file, and it will be accessible from the Table of Contents within the application.</li></ol><br>For example:<br><pre>{\n    \"title\": \"New Topic\",\n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Subsection\",\n            \"content\": \"Content goes here...\"\n        }\n    ]\n}</pre>"
