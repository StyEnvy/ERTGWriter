Welcome to the realm of Erainor...\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"type\": \"linear\",\n        \"next_stage_id\": 2\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}</pre><br>This structure defines the chapter's narrative flow and contains properties for each stage, such as <b>id</b>, <b>text</b>, and <b>properties</b>. The <b>properties</b> object further specifies the stage's type, next_stage_id, and other attributes. The above formatting ensures that the JSON file is easily readable and maintainable."
